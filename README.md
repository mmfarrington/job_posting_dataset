# Using Supervised ML Classifiers to Identify Fake Job Postings

This was a final student project I submitted for CIS 600 - Data Mining Course at Syracuse University in Spring 2020. 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction/kernels

In this project I train and evaluate several supervised learning classifier models to predict false job postings in a dataset of ~18k postings.
The results of my experiments and performance metrics are are captured in the ppt presentation and pdf writeup. 

## Installation

Source code can be downloaded in either html or ipynb format
Notebook includes lines to output classifier model results to csv
